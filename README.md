# Linux Privilege Escalation Field Manual

This repository is a practical, OSCP-style field manual for Linux privilege escalation.
It focuses on **methodology, manual enumeration, and real-world exploitation techniques**
used during penetration testing and CTF-style labs.

## Goals
- Build a repeatable Linux privilege escalation methodology
- Understand *why* an escalation works, not just *how*
- Prioritize manual techniques before automation
- Serve as a long-term reference during OSCP preparation

## Scope
- Local enumeration
- Misconfigurations
- SUID binaries
- Linux capabilities
- Cron jobs
- PATH hijacking
- Kernel exploits
- Credential harvesting
- Manual vs automated approaches

## Philosophy
> Enumerate first. Exploit second. Automate last.
